# The Broken Denizen.

This is just a little denizen script I decided to make. It's the broken script mod, but on plugin.

Sorry for the messy code, credits to the original creator of _The Broken Script_

**Requirements:**
- Libs disguises
- The resource pack provided
- Denizen script
- Minecraft version **1.20.4**

---

# What can this plugin do?

Plugin can:

- Disable chat messages  
- Grief bases  
- **Crash** Minecraft clients
- Make you unable to exit the server

---

# About crashes.

This plugin has events that crash the Minecraft client, but **no crash method is provided**.  
You must research and supply one yourself (e.g. particle crash).

If no crash is chosen, the plugin will just kick the player.
