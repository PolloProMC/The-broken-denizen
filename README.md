# About crashes.

This plugin has events that crash the Minecraft client, but **no crash method is provided**.  
You must research and supply one yourself (e.g. particle crash).

To insert a crash, go to the bottom of the script, above the ignore section, and look for the "nullcrash" command.
You can insert a crash of your choise there.

If no crash is chosen, the plugin will just kick the player.
