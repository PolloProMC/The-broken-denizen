# The Broken Denizen.

This is just a little denizen script I decided to make. It's the broken script mod, but on plugin.

Sorry for the messy code, credits to the original creator of _The Broken Script_

**Requirements:**
- Libs disguises
- The resource pack provided
- Denizen script
- Minecraft version **1.21.3 or lower.**

# What can this plugin do?

Plugin can:

- Disable chat messages  
- Grief bases  
- **Crash** Minecraft clients
- Make you unable to exit the server

# About crashes.

This plugin has events that crash the Minecraft client, but **no crash method is provided**.  
You must research and supply one yourself (e.g. particle crash).

To insert a crash, go to the bottom of the script, above the ignore section, and look for the "nullcrash" command.
You can insert a crash of your choise there.

If no crash is chosen, the plugin will just kick the player.
